# Instructions
Welcome to your last Code Challenge! In this challenge, you are going to build a MEAN stack application. The application you are going to build is a simple message board. You may use the base project supplied by your instructors as a platform to start from.

Just relax and show us what you know!
Thanks and good luck!

## Message Board Application
The message board application you are going to build has the following requirements:

* MUST use Angular and MongoDB (however the MongoDB code has been written for you),

* You may use however many controllers you would like, but you must use the factory provided to do the $http calls, which have been written for you,

* Your Front End should have two inputs. One for the user's name, the other for the user's message. Additionally, there should be a submit button,

* When the submit button is clicked, you must send the name and message from the inputs to the server to be written to a Mongo Database,

* Once the message has been successfully written to the database, display all messages on the DOM,

* If the application page is reloaded, all previous messages should appear.

### No HARD or PRO mode on this. Please do not host on Heroku or mLabs. 

Once you have completed the application, please submit via GitHub link, then quietly exit the room. 
Thanks!
